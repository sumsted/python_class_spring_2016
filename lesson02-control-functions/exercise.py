# create a block of code that loops while i is less than 10
# increment i in the code block
# create a block of code that iterates from 0 to 9
# print the iterated value in the block

# create a block of code that iterates through the list of names
names = ['Jefferson', 'Josh', 'Autumn', 'Emily', 'Daniel', 'Nicholas']

# print each name in the block of code
# define and call a function that asks for your name and then prints it


# define and call a function that asks for two numbers, then prints the sum of these numbers

# Define and call a function that takes a name as a parameter then prints the name


# Define and call a function that takes two numbers as parameters then prints the sum of these numbers

# Define and call a function that takes a name as a parameter then returns the name*2
# print the returned result


# Define and call a function that takes two numbers as parameters then returns the sum of these numbers
# print the returnedresult
